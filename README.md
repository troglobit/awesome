This is a fork of the official upstream project.
Hardcore users should go there instead.

If you want to test my setup, start by cloning
this repo:

```sh
cd ~/.config/
mv awesome awesome-pre-troglo
git clone blablalba/awesome.git
cd awesome/
git submodule update --init
```

Now restart Awesome, or reboot your machine.
